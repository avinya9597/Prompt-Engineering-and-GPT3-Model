# Prompt-Engineering-and-GPT3-Model

In this project we will be utilizing GPT-3, OpenAI's powerful language model. With GPT-3, we can accomplish various tasks without the need for extensive model training. The key lies in converting tasks into text generation tasks using prompts, a set of instructions that guide GPT-3's responses.

Task Example: Sentiment Classification
Let's take the task of sentiment classification as an example. We aim to determine whether a given tweet carries a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. By framing the task appropriately using prompts, we can achieve this effortlessly.

## Zero-Shot Learning
In zero-shot learning, we provide no explicit guidance to GPT-3 about the task's specifics. 

_For instance:_
Prompt: "Decide whether a Tweet's sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative. 
Tweet: I loved the new Batman movie!"
GPT-3 Response: "Positive"

## One-Shot Learning and Few-Shot Learning
In contrast, one-shot learning involves providing a single labeled example to guide GPT-3's response, while few-shot learning entails providing multiple labeled examples for better predictions.

_One-Shot Learning Example:_
Prompt: "Decide whether a Tweet's sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative. 
Tweet: I really liked the Spiderman movie!"
GPT-3 Response: "Positive"

_Few-Shot Learning Example:_
Prompt: "Decide whether a Tweet's sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative. 
Tweet: I loved the new Batman movie! Sentiment:"
Additional Example: "Tweet: The weather ruined my plans. Sentiment: Negative"
GPT-3 Response: Based on the provided examples, GPT-3 makes predictions with enhanced accuracy.
